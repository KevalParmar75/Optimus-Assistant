Once you run python optimus.py, the Optimus HUD will launch. Here is how to control your new assistant:

Move the HUD: Click and drag the circular UI anywhere on your screen.

Switch Languages: Click the ENG, HIN, or GUJ toggles. The HUD colors will change to reflect the active language.

Trigger Listening: * Press the Left Shift key on your keyboard.

Or just say the wake word: "Optimus..."

Example Commands:

🖥️ "Optimus, open Calculator" * 🎵 "Play Blinding Lights on YouTube"

🔍 "Search my liked videos for Python tutorials"

🧠 "What is the distance to the moon?"

⚠️ Troubleshooting & Common Fixes
"ModuleNotFoundError" for PyAudio: If speech recognition fails to build, you likely need PyAudio.

Windows: pip install pyaudio

Linux: sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio before pip installing.

Mac: brew install portaudio then pip install pyaudio.

YouTube Auth Hangs: On the very first run, a browser window will open asking you to log into your Google Account. Once you approve it, a token.pickle file is generated so you don't have to log in again.

Audio Playing Too Fast/Slow: If pygame throws errors, ensure your system's default audio output is properly configured and not exclusively locked by another app.
